<p class="lead">@mospherix was founded by a down-to-Earth type guy who's always been interested in websites and weather. Along came the MODX Cloud. Bright, sunny days followed. CAPE (Convective Available Potential Energy) went through the roof. Stormchasers followed.</p>


<p class="lead">In the right hands, the MODX Cloud shifts its shape to be what you want it to be. Potent web applications rain their data onto fertile ground. Happy customers sprout positive relationships. People grow, everybody happy.</p>

<p class="lead">Hey! Yeah! You! You! Get onto my Cloud!</p>

<p>@mospherix supports 350.org, local political candidates, and local organic food.</p>

<p>Did you know that you cannot separate the air from the ground, nor the ground from the water? What impacts the atmosphere impacts the land and water.</p>

<p>The MODX Cloud is similar to the air, land, water connection in that it neatly brings together 3 separate eco-systems and displays them as a whole. HTML5 + CSS3 + MODX creates whatever @mospherix you need.</p>
